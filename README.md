#NumNumNum

An app that I created in my junior summer. 

A puzzle game where you have to reach three numbers with an operator and other number. The operator and number are buttons that you can press to create more numbers. 

RULES:
There is a limit to how high the number can be. 
The number cannot be negative.
Numbers cannot be repeated.
You must beat the level before in order to play the next level. 

Although not entirely finished, the concept of the game is complete. 

Download instructions:

1.) Download Xcode

2.) Download the file and open it on Xcode
              or 
3.) git clone https://github.com/bentaro89/NumNumNum.git in terminal and open it through xcode there

4.) Run simulation on iphone 8 for best experience 


NOTE: Level NOOB 1-5 and Legend are the only levels that are playable. The rest of the levels are under construction. You can scroll in the level menu to see all 50 levels.
